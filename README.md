# Goblin
Goblin is a phishing rehearsal tool for red-blue confrontation. By using a reverse proxy, it is possible to obtain information about a user without affecting the user's operation perceptibly, or to induce the user's operation. The purpose of hiding the server side can also be achieved by using a proxy. Built-in plug-in, through a simple configuration, quickly adjust the content of the web page to achieve a better exercise effect.

## :triangular_ruler: Plugin System

See documentation for introduction details and usage üëâ [Plug-in system](https://goblin.xiecat.fun/plugin/).

## :battery: Advanced Usage

goblin uses a reverse proxy. The frontend uses a proxy such as cloudflare goblin, that can hide the goblin host. Documentation details can be found in the [goblin proxy configuration](https://goblin.xiecat.fun/guide/proxy.html).

### JS Injection

There are two ways to inject javascript: one is to follow the page (Replace requires you to append `\<script\>` tags), and the other is to follow the global js file, each approach has its own benefits.

Both of these actually use the Replace function.

#### Injecting with InjectJs

For details, please refer to [goblin InjectJs module](https://goblin.xiecat.fun/plugin/injectjs.html).

```yaml
- url: /base.js # JS to be replaced, with preference for global JS.
  Match: word   # Matching method.
  InjectJs:
    File: aaa.js # The JS to be replaced, it can be a file or a url.
```

#### Use replace to inject

For details, please refer to [goblin Replace module](https://goblin.xiecat.fun/plugin/replace.html).

```yaml
- url: /art_103.html # Pages to be replaced.
  Match: Word
  Replace: # Replacement Module.
    - Request:
        Method: # Match to the following request method before replacement.
          - GET
          - POST
        Header:
          goblin: 1.0.1  # Replace the header content. If empty, it is deleted.
      Response: # Replacement response content.
        Body:
          Append: "<script type='text/javascript' src='{{ .Static }}a.js'></script>" # Append string.
```
